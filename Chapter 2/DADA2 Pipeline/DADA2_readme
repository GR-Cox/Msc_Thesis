This is a alternative pipeline for processing 18S micro-eukaryote data.
Tutorials for this pipeline can be found at https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/ or https://github.com/fiererlab/dada2_fiererlab.
Both tutorials heavily inspired the code presented here.

This pipeline was modified to run multiple different variants at the same time on a virtual machine.
The default pipeline merges forward and reverse reads, however, this can cause issues with longer read 18S sequences as too few sequences merge.
The forward only version pipeline discards the merging step to get more reads through the pipeline.
The N_mash pipeline uses both forward and reverse reads but instead of merging it concatenates the two reads together with a string of Ns, helping more reads to pass the filters. 

When running the pipeline you can run all three pipelines at once and then immediately move into the pipeline formatting
